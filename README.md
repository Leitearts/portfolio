# Kelvin Wanyama – Portfolio

This is my personal cybersecurity portfolio, built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://react.dev/), and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It's where I showcase projects, skills, and write about digital forensics, incident response, and the art of defending systems.

This project was originally scaffolded using [create.xyz](https://create.xyz/).
